## ⚖️ Ethics vs Law 

- **Ethics** refers to what is *responsible and appropriate*
- **Laws** refer to what is *legally required*

Something can be:
- Ethical but not legally required
- Legal but still unethical

When using Generative AI, **both apply**.



## 🇵🇭 Applicable Laws in the Philippines

Existing laws apply even when AI is involved.



### 📘 RA 10173 — Data Privacy Act of 2012

This law protects **personal and sensitive information**.

#### Key principles:
- Personal data must be collected and used responsibly
- Consent and purpose matter
- Data subjects have rights

#### Implications for AI users:
- AI tools must not be used to process personal data without authority
- Uploading names, IDs, contact details, or private records to AI tools may violate the law
- AI platforms should be treated as external systems unless officially approved

📌 Responsibility lies with the **user and organization**, not the AI tool.



### 📕 RA 8293 — Intellectual Property Code of the Philippines

This law protects **original works**, including:
- Written content
- Visual designs
- Creative outputs

#### Implications for AI-generated content:
- AI-generated outputs may be based on existing copyrighted material
- Claiming AI-generated work as entirely original may raise legal concerns
- Users must review and ensure compliance with copyright rules

📌 Using AI does **not remove responsibility** for intellectual property compliance.



## 🧾 Accountability and Responsibility

From a legal perspective:
- AI tools do not carry legal responsibility
- Developers, organizations, and users remain accountable
- Errors, misuse, or violations cannot be blamed on the AI system



## 🏢 Workplace and Institutional Policies

In addition to national laws:
- Organizations may have internal AI usage policies
- These policies may restrict:
  - Data types allowed
  - Tools that can be used
  - How AI-generated content is handled

📌 Always follow **institutional guidelines** when using AI at work or in training.
