# ⚖️ Ethical Use of Generative AI

Generative AI is a powerful tool, but using it responsibly is just as important as knowing how it works.



## 🤝 Why Ethics Matter in Generative AI

Generative AI can:
- Create content quickly
- Sound confident and convincing
- Influence decisions and opinions

Because of this, **how we use AI matters**.

AI can assist us — but it should never replace **human responsibility**.



## ©️ Copyright and Ownership

Generative AI can create text, images, and other content, but this raises questions about ownership.

### What you need to know:
- AI does **not** own the content it generates
- Humans remain responsible for how AI outputs are used
- AI-generated content may be based on existing materials

### Practical reminder:
- Do not assume AI-generated content is automatically “original”
- Review, edit, and take responsibility for the final output
- Follow workplace or institutional rules on content ownership



## ❌ Misinformation and Fake Content

Generative AI can sometimes produce information that:
- Sounds correct
- Looks professional
- Is actually false or misleading

This includes risks such as:
- False explanations
- Incorrect facts
- Realistic but fake images or videos (e.g., deepfakes)

### Your responsibility as a user:
- Always verify important information
- Do not share AI-generated content blindly
- Be cautious when content may affect people, decisions, or reputation



## ⚖️ Bias and Fairness

AI systems learn from large datasets created by humans.  
If the data contains bias, the AI may reflect it.

This means AI outputs may:
- Reinforce stereotypes
- Favor certain viewpoints
- Exclude important perspectives

### What you should do:
- Review outputs critically
- Avoid using AI results as the sole basis for decisions
- Apply fairness and judgment, especially in sensitive contexts



## 🔐 Privacy and Data Protection

Anything you enter into an AI tool may be stored or processed externally.

### 🚫 Do NOT share:
- Personal information
- Confidential work data
- Sensitive or private details

### 🇵🇭 Legal reminder:
- **RA 10173 – Data Privacy Act of 2012** protects personal and sensitive information
- Treat AI tools as public systems unless officially approved



## 🧠 Generative AI as a Tool, Not a Decision-Maker

Think of Generative AI as:
- An assistant
- A draft generator
- A support tool

Not as:
- A final authority
- A replacement for judgment
- A decision-maker

📌 **AI assists — humans decide.**



## 🎨 Simple Analogy: The Artist and the Tool

Think of Generative AI like a paintbrush.

- The paintbrush does not decide what to paint
- The artist chooses how to use it
- The artist is responsible for the final artwork

In the same way:
- AI generates suggestions
- Humans choose, review, and apply them responsibly



## 🧭 Ethical Checklist Before Using AI

Before using AI output, ask yourself:
- Did I review this carefully?
- Is the information safe to share?
- Could this harm or mislead others?
- Am I still accountable for the result?

If the answer is unclear, **pause and reassess**.



## ✅ Key Takeaways

- Ethical use of AI requires human judgment
- AI can generate errors, bias, or misinformation
- Privacy and data protection must be respected
- Responsibility always remains with the user
