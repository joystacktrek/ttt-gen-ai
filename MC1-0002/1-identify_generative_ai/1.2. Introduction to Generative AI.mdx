## 🤖 What Is Generative AI?

**Generative Artificial Intelligence (Generative AI)** refers to AI systems that can **create new content**, such as:

- Text (emails, summaries, reports)
- Images (designs, posters, illustrations)
- Audio (voice, music)
- Video (short clips, avatars)

Unlike traditional software that follows fixed rules, Generative AI works by learning patterns from data and generating outputs based on those patterns.



## 🧠 How Generative AI Is Different from Traditional Software

**Traditional software:**
- Follows fixed rules
- Produces the same output for the same input
- Requires users to adapt to the system

**Generative AI:**
- Learns patterns from data
- Can produce different outputs
- Adapts to how users ask questions or give instructions

> 📌 If the system helps you *create* content, not just display it, it is likely Generative AI.



## 🧩 Common Types of Generative AI

Generative AI can be grouped based on what it creates:

- **Text-based AI** – writes, summarizes, or rewrites text
- **Image-based AI** – generates or edits images and designs
- **Audio AI** – creates or transcribes voice and sound
- **Video AI** – generates short videos or visual content
- **Multimodal AI** – works with text, images, and audio together

You will see examples of these types when you access AI tools later.



## 💼 Where You May Encounter Generative AI

You may already be using Generative AI in:
- Email and messaging apps (suggested replies)
- Document tools (writing assistance)
- Design platforms (auto-generated layouts)
- Search and productivity tools

Generative AI is commonly used as an **assistant**, not a replacement for human work.



## ⚠️ Important Reminder

Generative AI:
- Does **not** think like humans
- Does **not** always provide correct information
- May produce confident but incorrect answers

Always review and verify AI-generated content before using it.



## 🔐 Responsible Use

When using Generative AI:
- Avoid sharing personal or confidential information
- Respect intellectual property
- Take responsibility for the final output

AI assists — humans decide.
