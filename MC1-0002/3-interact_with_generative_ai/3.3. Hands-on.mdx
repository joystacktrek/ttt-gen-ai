# 💡 Activity 3: Brainstorm for Your Work or Personal Life

Choose something from your **work or personal life** where you need inspiration.

This could be:
- An upcoming project where you want to try new planning strategies  
- A meeting you’re leading and need fun icebreakers to engage participants  
- Blog or content ideas to keep readers coming back  
- A personal task, such as brainstorming dinner recipes based on the ingredients in your fridge  

Use a generative AI tool to brainstorm ideas for your chosen situation.



## ✍️ Step 1: Enter Your Initial Prompt

Enter a prompt into the gen AI tool.  
For this first step, include **only the task** from the prompting framework.  
You’ll add the rest of the framework in later steps.



## 🔍 Step 2: Evaluate Output

Evaluate whether the output includes ideas that:
- Help you accomplish all parts of your brainstorming goal  
- Relate to the context of your brainstorming goal  
- Align with what you were expecting the output to be  



## 🔁 Step 3: Take an Iterative Approach

Revise and refine your prompt by adding more of the prompting framework.  
For example, you could:
- Specify the format you want (e.g., bullet points or a table)  
- Add three to four sentences of additional context  
- Provide examples as references  
- Restructure your prompt into simpler sentences  
- Ask follow-up questions  

When you’re ready, enter your new prompt. Continue iterating until the output gives you **relevant, accurate, and helpful ideas** that truly spark your creativity.
