# ☕ Break Activity: Say What You See

Before starting **Activity 5**, take a short break and practice your image-generation prompting skills through a fun, visual game.

This helps you:
- Practice writing clear and detailed visual descriptions  
- Understand how prompts influence generated images  
- Improve your image-generation prompting skills
