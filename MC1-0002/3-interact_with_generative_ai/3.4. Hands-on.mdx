# 👕 Activity 4: Brainstorm a New T-Shirt Design

You own **Clothing Essentials Company**, a small business targeting **middle-income consumers aged 18 to 39**. You’re brainstorming a new T-shirt to include in your newest clothing line, the **Minimalist Collection**.

To do this well, you need to consider:
- What colors or patterns are trending with your target customers?
- What styles are currently popular?
- What price point your customers are comfortable with?

For reference, your best-selling line is the **Lounge Collection**, which features soft, comfortable loungewear designed for relaxing at home.

You’ve written an initial prompt:
> “Give me ideas for new T-shirts for my clothing store.”

However, this prompt does not follow the prompting framework, so the output is vague and needs improvement.



## ✍️ Step 1: Enter Your Initial Prompt

Enter the initial prompt into a generative AI tool:
> “Give me ideas for new T-shirts for my clothing store.”

Review the output, noting that it lacks specificity and useful detail.



## 🔍 Step 2: Evaluate Output

Evaluate whether the output:
- Addresses your target audience (ages 18–39, middle-income)
- Considers trends, styles, and pricing
- Aligns with the **Minimalist Collection** and your existing **Lounge Collection**

Identify what information is missing or unclear.



## 🔁 Step 3: Take an Iterative Approach

Revise and refine your prompt using more of the prompting framework. You may:
- Add context about your brand, audience, and collections  
- Specify the format (e.g., bullet points or a table)  
- Ask for trending colors, styles, and price ranges  
- Provide your Lounge Collection as a reference  
- Ask follow-up questions to refine the ideas  

Enter your revised prompt and continue iterating until the AI provides **clear, relevant, and actionable T-shirt ideas** that fit your Minimalist Collection.
