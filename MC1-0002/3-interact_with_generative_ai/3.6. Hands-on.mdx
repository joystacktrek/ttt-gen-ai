# 👕 Activity 6: Create an Image for the Minimalist Collection

You own **Clothing Essentials Company**, a small business targeting **middle-income consumers aged 18 to 39**. Each season, you release new collections based on current trends.

Your newest line, the **Minimalist Collection**, is designed for young adults who identify as minimalists—balancing busy work schedules with an active social life. If you completed the previous activity, you already brainstormed T-shirt ideas for this collection.

The **Minimalist Collection** includes:
- **Long-sleeve cotton shirt** (white, gray, teal, navy, forest green)
- **Short-sleeve cotton shirt** (white, gray, teal, navy, forest green)
- **Tank top** (white, gray, teal, navy, forest green)

Your task is to use a generative AI tool to create an **image that tells the story of the Minimalist Collection**.

Before prompting, consider:
- How will the image appeal to busy young adults?
- Will you highlight a few key pieces or the entire collection?
- What lighting and background will best fit a minimalist aesthetic?



## ✍️ Step 1: Enter Your Initial Prompt

Enter an initial prompt into the gen AI image tool.  
For this step, include **only the task**, such as creating an image that represents the Minimalist Collection.



## 🔍 Step 2: Evaluate Output

Evaluate whether the generated image:
- Appeals to your target audience (ages 18–39)
- Reflects a minimalist lifestyle and aesthetic
- Effectively showcases the collection or key pieces
- Uses appropriate lighting, colors, and composition

Identify what feels unclear or could be improved.



## 🔁 Step 3: Take an Iterative Approach

Refine your prompt by adding more details from the prompting framework. You may:
- Specify which items to feature (one item vs the full collection)
- Describe the setting, lighting, and background colors
- Define the style (clean, modern, lifestyle-focused, studio shot)
- Add references or examples of minimalist fashion imagery
- Ask for variations or adjustments

Continue iterating until the image clearly and effectively tells the story of the **Minimalist Collection**.
