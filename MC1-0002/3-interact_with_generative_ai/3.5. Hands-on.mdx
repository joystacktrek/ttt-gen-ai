# 🖼️ Activity 5: Image Generation with Gen AI

In this activity, you’ll use the **5-step prompting framework** to create an image using a generative AI tool.

You may create an image for **work or personal use**. If you’re unsure what to create, use the scenario below.



## 🧠 Prompting Reminder

When crafting your prompt, remember:

- **Thoughtfully**: Describe the task, persona, and format  
- **Create**: Add helpful context  
- **Really**: Include references or examples  
- **Excellent**: Evaluate the output  
- **Inputs**: Iterate to improve results  

### 🖌️ Best Practices for Image Prompts
- Use vivid, clear descriptions  
- Specify size, colors, and object placement  
- Describe the overall style or aesthetic  
- Provide examples or references if possible  



## 🛠 AI Tool Access

Use any **image-generating AI tool** of your choice (e.g., Gemini, ChatGPT, Midjourney, Craiyon, Poe).

The steps below reference **Gemini**, available at: **gemini.google.com**  
> Always double check tool features, as generative AI tools change frequently.



## 🎯 Scenario (Optional)

Choose an image you might need for work or personal life, such as:
- A visual to kick off a work project  
- A logo for a newsletter or brand  
- An image for a presentation  
- A sketch of a new idea or invention  

Keep the **purpose and audience** of the image in mind.



## ✍️ Step 1: Enter Your Initial Prompt

Enter a prompt into the gen AI tool.  
For this step, include **only the task** (what image you want created).



## 🔍 Step 2: Evaluate Output

Evaluate whether the image:
- Matches your intended purpose  
- Fits your audience  
- Reflects the style or idea you had in mind  

Identify what could be improved.



## 🔁 Step 3: Take an Iterative Approach

Refine your prompt by adding more of the prompting framework. You may:
- Add detailed descriptions (colors, size, layout)  
- Specify a visual style or aesthetic  
- Provide references or examples  
- Ask for variations or adjustments  

Continue iterating until the image meets your expectations and clearly serves its purpose.
