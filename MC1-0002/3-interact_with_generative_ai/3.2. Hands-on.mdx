# 🧳 Activity 2: Plan a Vacation with Gen AI

In this activity, you'll practice using the **5-step prompting framework** to plan a vacation.

Sometimes, the most challenging part of making a plan is taking the first step. Thankfully, generative AI makes planning easier and more efficient—whether you’re coming up with a timeframe for an important work project or making a plan to finally organize your to-do list.



## 🧠 5-Step Prompting Framework

When crafting your prompts, remember:

- **Thoughtfully**: Describe your task, specifying a persona and format preference.  
- **Create**: Include any context the gen AI tool might need to give you what you want.  
- **Really**: Add references the gen AI tool can use to inform its output.  
- **Excellent**: Evaluate the output to identify opportunities for improvement.  
- **Inputs**: Iterate on your initial prompt to attain those improvements.



## 🛠 AI Tool Access

To complete this activity, you can use **any browser-based generative AI tool** of your choice.

The steps below feature **Gemini**, which you can access at: **gemini.google.com**

> Generative AI technology is dynamic and ever-changing, so always double check what features and capabilities are available in the tools you’re using.



## 🌴 Scenario: Plan Your Perfect Vacation

Think of your ideal getaway—the one you daydream about. It might be a beachside escape, or an adventure in a city you’ve never been to before.

Gen AI tools are great at helping you plan:
- When to travel  
- How to get there  
- What to pack  
- How to budget  
- What to do during the trip  

You will:
1. Write an initial prompt asking the gen AI tool to identify the necessary planning steps for your vacation.
2. Iterate on your prompt to get more detail and a better plan.



## ✅ Step 1: Enter Your Initial Prompt

1. Open a new tab and go to your gen AI tool of choice.
2. Write an initial prompt asking for the planning steps for your trip **from start to finish**.

### Example Prompt (Task)
> “I’m planning a vacation to **[place/description]**. What planning steps should I consider?”

### Add Context (Constraints + Preferences)
Include details that affect your plan, such as:
- Time of year to travel  
- Dietary needs  
- Budget limits  
- Travel style (relaxed vs packed schedule)  

Example:
> “I want to travel in **[time of year]**. I need the plan to include considerations for **[type of food]**.”

### Add References (Optional but Helpful)
You can upload or paste:
- An itinerary you found online  
- A list of must-visit places  
- A checklist you want to follow  

Example:
> “I want the trip to include activities like the list attached.”

3. When ready, submit your prompt in the gen AI tool.

> 💡 **Pro Tip: Prompt to Brainstorm**  
> If you’re not sure where you want to go, ask the gen AI tool to generate vacation destination ideas first—then choose one and start planning.



## 🔍 Step 2: Evaluate

Review the output and identify what information you may still need.

Some parts of your prompt may lead the tool down the wrong path—evaluation helps you spot those issues.

### Use these evaluation questions:
- Is the plan easy to follow?
- Is it organized into steps with clear actions?
- Does it include key planning areas like:
  - Deciding travel dates
  - Booking accommodation
  - Choosing transportation
  - Considering preferences (dietary, budget, travel pace)
  - Planning activities during the trip

Also reflect:
- Which parts of the prompting framework were missing from your first prompt?
  - Task
  - Context
  - References
  - Evaluate
  - Iterate



## 🔁 Step 3: Take an Iterative Approach

Revise and refine your prompt to improve the plan and get more detail.

This is your big trip—make sure you’re getting exactly what you want.

### Ways to improve your next prompt:
- Make your task more specific
- Add **3–4 sentences** of additional context
- Add references (links, lists, sample itinerary)
- Ask the tool to expand one step (e.g., budgeting or itinerary)
- Ask: **“Do you have questions for me?”**
- Request a format that helps you stay organized (like a spreadsheet or checklist)

When ready, enter your revised prompt—then continue iterating until you feel confident the output is truly useful.

> 💡 **Pro Tip: Iterate on Each Step**  
> Once you have the full list of steps, you can use the prompting framework to complete each one.  
> Example: If your first step is setting a budget, ask the tool to create a budget breakdown—then adjust the trip plan based on the budget output.
